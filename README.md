# Project: Strategic Solar Investment Analysis for MoonLight Energy Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and strategic report developed to enhance the operational efficiency and sustainability of MoonLight Energy Solutions. The primary goal was to evaluate environmental measurements provided by the engineering team and translate the findings into a data-driven strategy to identify high-potential regions for solar installation. The analysis leverages statistical methods and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to inform strategic decisions aligning with the company's long-term sustainability goals.

## Objective
- Perform a detailed analysis of environmental data to identify trends and insights.
- Provide a strategic recommendation for high-potential regions suitable for solar investments.
- Support data-driven decision-making to optimize MoonLight Energy Solutions' operational efficiency and sustainability.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Gathered and preprocessed the environmental measurement data provided by the engineering team.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted an initial assessment to understand the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the data.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Applied statistical techniques to identify key trends and evaluate the significance of different factors affecting solar potential.
4. **Visualization**: Created visual representations of data trends and relationships to aid in decision-making.
5. **Insight Generation**: Identified high-potential regions based on the analysis and summarized findings for strategic use.

## Key Findings
- Identification of regions with the highest average solar irradiance and low shadow impact.
- Correlation between weather patterns and optimal solar performance.
- Regional patterns indicating the most suitable areas for large-scale solar investments.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize investments in regions exhibiting consistently high solar irradiance and favorable climate conditions.
- Implement a phased rollout strategy to begin with the top-ranking regions based on current data and expand as more data becomes available.
- Consider potential partnerships with local entities in identified high-potential regions to streamline installation processes and sustainability efforts.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA and analysis
- Git for version control
